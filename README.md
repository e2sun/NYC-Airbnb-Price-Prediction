# 🏡 Lab 5 – NYC Airbnb Price Prediction

This repository contains the work for **Lab 5**, which focuses on building a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices in New York City using real-world open data.

The project walks through the full ML pipeline — from preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and export — using the NYC Airbnb Open Data set.
